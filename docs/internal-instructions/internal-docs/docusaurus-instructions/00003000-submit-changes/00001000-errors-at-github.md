# Errors at Github

When everything is done right, no error received while running locally and your latest changes is already submitted, Github starts to recompile this page.
If everything is good, your changes should appear within few minutes.

## Updates is not visible on the page
Otherwise, there can be an additional errors on the server that local environment didn't catch.

Those errors can appear for the same reasons as listed here: 
<LinkToAnotherPage path="../edit-content#error-handling" text="Error handling"/>

## Github Actions

GitHub Actions is a feature of GitHub that allows you to automate workflows directly within your GitHub repository. In this context, it is used to render page after every commit of changes.

If our changes after commit didn't rendered, we can check if action failed. Go to:
<LinkToAnotherPage path="https://github.com/Vecticum/vecticum-docusaurus/actions" text="Github actions"/>

We will see a list of previous runs.
