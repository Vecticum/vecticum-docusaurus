# Icons

You can add icons to your text from Font Awesome. Only free icons can be used (the same as currently used in vecticum apps).

All icons can be found here:

<LinkToAnotherPage text="Font Awesome" path="https://fontawesome.com/search?"></LinkToAnotherPage>

P.S. Only free icons is good to use. PRO isn't supported.

Examples:

## Just icon
```
<FontAwesomeIcon icon="fa-solid fa-download" />
```

Result: <FontAwesomeIcon icon="fa-solid fa-download" />

## Icon in text

```

Result:
