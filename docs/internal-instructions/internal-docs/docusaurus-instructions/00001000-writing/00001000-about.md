# Introduction to MD file

Every page of instructions are saved in MD file. You can simply create new MD file and start typing, for example:

myNewFile.md:
> \# My new page<br></br>
> I will write something here!

This will look like this:

![](/assets/instruction-images/example-first-md-file.png)

This is the base of MD file.
