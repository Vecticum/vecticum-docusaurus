# How to Assign Employees to a Training

You can only assign employees to the entire training program, not to separate training activities.

There are two ways to do that - via Training Programs section in the main menu or via the Employee card.

### In the Training Programs section

Go to **Trainings** > **Training Programs** and open the required training program. Then, go to **Assigned Employees** tab and select **Assign Employee to Training Program** button.

| Setting          | Description                                                             |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Employee         | Here, choose an employee to whom you want to assign a training program. |
| Training Program | A training program that is being edited is selected here by default.    |

### In Employee Card

Go to **HR Core** > **Employees** and open the card of the required employee. Then, go to **Training** section and select **Assign Employee to Training Program** button.

| Setting          | Description                                                              |
