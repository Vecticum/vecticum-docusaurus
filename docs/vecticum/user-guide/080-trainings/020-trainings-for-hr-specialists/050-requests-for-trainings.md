# Requests for Trainings

Employees can create requests for training activities other than those assigned to them. To do that, they have to go to their **Employee card** > **Training** section and select **Add Employee Training** button.

When a request is created, it is sent to employee's direct manager for approval and simultaneously listed in the **Report** section where you can view its details and status.
