The  Vecticum system user can be created from person card (in 'Login info' tab on the person form ).  &#x20;

From the person card it is possible to create employee. This is the case when in Vecticum company system we would like to use HR Core functionality and treat such person user as employee and manage his personel information by the functionality module HR Core provides in Vecticum platform.

There are the cases when employees are not created from persons. It is more convenient to operate on persons when:

* there is no HR Core functionality deployed for the Vecticum system (for certain instance of the company),
* the person - user is not the employee of the company for which the vecticum system is prepared. It can be technical support user from vecitum or other 3rd party personal contact,
* there is aware decision that such person - user data are not supposed to be managed by HR Core functionality in Vecticum. Even if uploaded in Vecticum, there is decision that it is not used for the moment or permanently (and  for example the persons - users are defined only in order to participate in using other modules like Invoice processing).  &#x20;

Person card includes straight forward, directly defined values from dictionaries like: Job Title, Department, Line Manager. This is simplified approach to the one used on the employee card in where these information are extracted from the latest valid related with the employee job information records.
