Note: Pressing "SAVE" automatically activates the workflows for posting approval. Until the first validator of the work sequence approves, you can adjust the posting details.

Employees listed in the Approval fields (hereafter referred to as Validators) will automatically receive electronic notifications of a request for posting when you click on SAVE. Validators receive assignments for validation sequentially i.e. only after the first approver approves the posting, the next approver will receive the assignment.

You will be notified by e-mail of the approval or rejection of the mission and the payment of the advance by electronic letter.

:::warning
To delegate tasks to a substitute person while you are on a business trip, you must go to your Employee card, select Out of Office, and indicate a substitute person there. Specifying a substitute in a Business trip form will not delegate the tasks.
