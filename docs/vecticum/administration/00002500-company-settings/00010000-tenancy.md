## Intercompany Write Persmissions

By default system workflows can only create and update documents in the same company. This limitation can be overcome for companies connected by a tenant. This requires the configuration of "Intercompany Write Permissions" and activation of the intercompany write feature for the tenant company (can only be actived by a programmer).

The relation "Intercompany Write Permissions" is a built in object that maps the company, connected by the tenant, to "Write Objects" that can be created in that company from another connected company. "Write Objects" is a classifier in which an object and several classes can be grouped. For the relation to work the configuration (object, class, form and view) of the object "Write Object" must be cloned to the tenant company and Write objects must be created.

An example of a create step configuration that uses intercompany write permission can be found here: [Create (Intercompany Write)](../workflows/workflow-steps#create-intercompany-write "mention").
