General description:

This method returns one record based on parameters from a hierarchy of related records. Uses cascade relation (latest amendment is related with previous amendment) as well at the same time direct relation to parent (all amendments are related with the main contract).



Function returns a lookup value of document that can be used in select or dropdown attributes.\
Algorithm: checks the document at "key", finds the main version of document by parentKeyInDocument, then collects all versions by top-to-bottom.\
If loop is detected (C01 -> C02 -> C03 -> C01), function breaks and returns nothing.

Fields:\
key - REQUIRED - key to the lookup attribute that contains the document. This is the only key used in this collection as parameter which is appearing on the same form to which  belongs attribute that we are applying this method in it's expression;\
parentKeyInDocument - REQUIRED - key to the parent document;\
sortKey - OPTIONAL (default: none) - all documents will be sorted by the given key;\
isOrderDescending - OPTIONAL (default: false) - changes sorting from ascending to descending;\
nthRecord - OPTIONAL (default: 0) - returns nth value of versions list. If number bigger than value list, acts as 0.\
filters - OPTIONAL (default: no filters) - pairs of attributes and values. Values can be multiple, separated by comma

Use case examples:\
If newest contract version is needed - order by desc and return 0-th value.\
If oldest contract version is needed - order by asc and return 0-th value.\
if documents with specific status is needed, add filter ("status.id": "kH7nQsqQHjITKbz1vg9N")\
if documents with specific statuses is needed, add filter ("status.id": "kH7nQsqQHjITKbz1vg9N, BNkm2KN8uzel29BbhC2r")

Example 1:

The above code example is implementation of value expression for 'Select' type attribute 'Valid contract' placed on the invoice form which takes another 'Select' type attribute (key: contractNo) as parameter. In 'Valid contract' is automatically resolved latest valid contract on the basis of appointed Contract (in key: contractNo).&#x20;

By select type attribute changeContractId system is appointing on contract amendment form to which main contract amendment belongs to.

Attribute contractChangeNo is used on contract amendment form and is appointing amendment number to root contract.

We are using descending order because we would like to return first (0nth) value from top which means the amendment with the highest number.

In this example there is applied filter for 2 values of statuses with OR clause. Second part of the filter is to take contract which are not marked as disabled (boolean type key: \_disabled) .

Example 2:

This example illustrates resolving from organizational structure cluster department.&#x20;

Business case is:&#x20;

on the purchase form we need to have cluster manager for additional approval (to be used in workflow). As clusters are marked only top (2nd) level departments. We already have on purchase form select type attribute for department (key: department) which is filled in automatically as department of author:

&#x20;

This way appointed department should be started point for searching for 'cluster department'. In order to do so we will deploy select type attribute which will be appointing also department: 'Cluster Department'. It will be in read-only mode. It will have value expression deployed in the following way with the use of the 'Get last document' method:

```javascript
const getLastDocument = #{getLastDocument({
  "key": "department",
  "parentKeyInDocument": "parentId",
  "nthRecord": 0,
  "filters":{
    "level": "1"
    }
   }
 )
}

const result = getLastDocument();
return result;
```

&#x20;"key": "department" -  Attribute 'Department of initiator', with the key: department is used for delivering to the method parameter value; it appoints which attribute to consider while building up hierarchy of the records to be searched in.

"parentKeyInDocument": "parentId" - on the department form there is 'Parent department' lookup attribute to department. So we are appointing this one in order to investigate each other relation between departments.&#x20;

Form beginning: system takes the department appointed in key: department (in attribute 'Department of initiator') from the purchase form (in this example it is TEST DEP2) , then checks which department is assigned to it as parent by investigating the key: parentId:

&#x20;

<figure>![](/assets/image_(435).png)</figure>

The it keeps itterrating this manner, building the hierarchy. System also in the destination collection not only records from this direct chain but also the found leaves of the members of hierarchy.

Please notice that in this example we are omitting optional parameters:

```
 "sortKey" and "isOrderDescending"
```

We are doing it because: 1) there is not clear additional indication of additional attribute (like it was contract version number in Example 1) which will give some order of the objects. 2) we are expecting only single value to remain after applying the filter to all members of hierarchy. That is why first value we will would like to be returned: "nthRecord": 0&#x20;

Filter is applied to all members of hierarchy by the specific markup (text key: level) on department form:

<figure>![](/assets/image_(436).png)</figure>

&#x20;The relation in this case is presented like the following:

<figure>![](/assets/image_(437).png)</figure>

Please notice that in this case hierarchy will also consist of the other departments which are not illustrated above but which are related like parent to the presented members for example to 'Administration' or any other leaves.  In this example we are only marking Administration as cluster department with level === '1'. So that is why after applying filter single value is returned:

<figure>![](/assets/image_(438).png)</figure>

The last stage will be to deploy next select type attribute to person, in read only which will return in value expression, assigned manager to cluster department; the value expression of the new attribute will be: &#x20;

```javascript
return ${clusterDepartmentId.managerId};
```

where clusterDepartmentId is the key for attribute 'Cluster Department' (to which value expression we were using new, described in here method).

<figure>![](/assets/image_(439).png)</figure>

Conclusion is that for resolving only from direct chain of department relation without any additional markup (like level or any systematic numbering of departments) current method would be difficult to used. However with additional markup - like in above presented case - is very useful instrument. &#x20;
