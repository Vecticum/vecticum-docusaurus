# Object Types

## Introduction

Object type is basically a template for objects that you want to create in the app.&#x20;

_Examples of object types usage for different business types:_

* There is predefined object type called 'Person' in system for representation of the people - separate persons (individuals).&#x20;
* Each specific group of business objects or documents representing them, should have created separate business type. For example in standard HR Core system from the employee card (HR Core -> Employees), in 'Employment & Compensation' section, you will find the related with employee, records which represent the details of employee's employment contract; in system we have created the separate object type for representing these records: 'Employment and Compensation'.
* Classification records of certain category also typically have created separate object type; for example  for mentioned above 'Employment and Compensation' documents, there is assigned on their form 'Employment Contract Type' (permanent, temporary, ...) . In order to reflect in the system this classification, there is created the object type: 'Employement Contract Type'.

_Introduction of the classes related with object type:_

Object type has sub-types called classes. You have to create at least one class for an object type.&#x20;

Related with object type classes, represent the different sub-types of the main object type. For example for the object type: 'Employment and Compensation', in system there are defined the following classes (each of them representing special type of employee's employment contract document (contract itself or it's update with annex) or key event related with it - termination of contract): 'Employment and Compensation', 'Amendment of the employment contract', 'Termination'. [Classes](object-types.md#classes) are described in below, after REGISTER tab.



## How to create an object type

Before creating an object type, it is recommended to  first create in advance, the new view  that you will use for this object type (see [Views](views.md); at least 1 attribute should be added to the view on this stage, further during the deployment, other attributes can be added to the view). Creation of the form will be needed during adding the classes to an object type.



To create an object type, go to Administration > Metadata > Object types and select **New Object Type**.&#x20;

| Name (plural)          | Plural form of the name. This is used as a title in lists.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 'New button' name      | Name of a button that opens a form for creating a new object, e.g., 'New document', 'New contract'.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Icon                   | <p>You can specify an icon that will be used in forms and lists next to the object name.</p><p>To choose an icon, go to Font Awesome (<a href="https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&#x26;m=free">https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&#x26;m=free</a>) and search for the icon you want. Open the icon and copy here the icon class name, e.g., far fa-file-alt OR fa fa-building.</p>                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Background color       | Select a background color for this object type. This color is used in e.g. calendars, as form header color etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| View                   | Assign a view for this object type. A view defines how objects are displayed in the list. It has to be created beforehand. Please see ([Views](views.md)).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Parent object type     | Specify a parent object type if your object type is dependent. The example of the usage of this attribute is in definition of object type: 'Purchase Invoice Costs Allocation' which represent cost allocation line for the purchase invoice. The line can not exist without the header of the invoice. The value of this attribute is assigned as 'Invoice' which appoints Invoice as parent object type for invoice allocation line.                                                                                                                                     |
| Parent key             | A key that links a parent object with a child object. This is the key which connects the defined object type to the parent object (specified in above described attribute 'Parent object type'). In fact this is the key of Children type attribute placed on the form (assigned to the related class) of parent object. In our example the value of the attribute is: costAllocations . This is the key for 'Cost Allocations' attribute, placed on 'Purchase Invoice' form (which is assigned to class 'Purchase Invoice', which is assigned to object type: 'Invoice'). |
| Data type              | <p></p><p>Specify what type of data the objects will contain. </p><ul><li>Setup data - use this data type for entries that will be created by admin in the Setup section. </li><li>User data - use this for objects that will be managed by users. </li><li>Built-in - this data type is used for objects that come built in the app.  </li></ul><p></p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Is Primary Object Type | This is the markup of the object type which is used in installation process for the App. If the object type is included in the App and marked this way, then system knows it should be treated like the main object during app install. It means that when App is installed the object type is uploaded with all the class children, related with them forms, attributes on the forms, related object types with attributes. But it stops on this stage, and with this markup is not uploading additionally all the other classes in where the  uploaded form is used.     |

[Classes](object-types.md#classes) are described in below, after REGISTER tab.

### **Registers**

For object type we are defining setup of registers. Registers are holding the definition of assignment of registration number to created documents / records of defined object types. Registration number is given for the document once during the lifetime of the document and is not changeable. By default the registration number is presented in top right corner of the document:

<figure>[](/assets/image_(77).png)</figure>

The documents with assigned registration number are not possible to be deleted (even for granted for edit action users) as long they have assigned registration number. The workaround method of deleting the document with assigned registration number is: 1) to add to the form of the document the attribute with assigned key: id\_registrationNo with Write option, which represents registration number, 2) on document form delete the attribute value of registration number, 3) then delete the document (Edit -> Delete from the menu of the document).

Here, you can edit settings of document registers. You will be able to create registers after the first save of the object type.

To create a new register, select **New Register**.&#x20;

| Register name                              | Name of a register.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Registration number prefix                 | Prefix that will be added before the registration number index (increasing part) . For example: VAR                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Registration number suffix                 | Suffix that will be added after the registration number index (increasing part). Typically it is not in use, as the increasing part of the number (index) is only prefixed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Leading Zeros count                        | Overall quantity of digits in registration number's index. For example, if your 'Leading Zeros count' is set to 4, the document index will be generated as 0001, 0002, 0003, etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Registration year                          | Year of the document registration. Typically remains empty if there is assumed  continuous register althrough, in consecutive calendar years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Is register active                         | Check the box to mark the register as active.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Is register default for auto-registration  | If checked, records will be added to this register by default, if not specified otherwise.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Next index                                 | The value for the next Index to be given during registration, in this defined register, of the document of certain object type. In the moment of creation of the register, value 1 should be inserted.                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Is filled by default with parent Object type.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Classes to register                        | Specifies the sub-set of the classes from the collection of the classes related with the object type. If this property is empty, then all the classes related with the object type (related with defined register) will be taken into account while performing registration of the documents (documents of the all classes  related with object type will be registered in this register). |

In the above example the full registration number will be composed like: VAR0001.

The whole registers are accessible in Administration -> Metadata -> Registers&#x20;

The registration is deployed typically by adding Workflow Step System according to the below definition ([#register](workflows/workflow-steps.md#register "mention")):

<figure>[](/assets/image_(180).png)</figure>

or by the definition of the Toolbar button in the class with Register action: [#toolbar](object-types.md#toolbar "mention")



_Register Custom introduction_

Functionality of 'Register Custom' is used for creating custom mechanisms of counters. It also can be applied for the inbuilt object types like person. The registration action is always triggering the increase of the counter. The differences between registration to custom register and standard register are: 1) you can delete the documents registered with the use 'register custom' , 2) the number given by registration with the use of 'register custom' functionality contains only counter (no pre or suffixes are in use). &#x20;

_How to setup Register Custom_

1\) Create attribute and place it on the form related with the class assigned to defined business type. It should be of simple type, for example Text. This attribute will be updated with the current number of defined 'Register Custom' in the moment of performing registration.

2\) Open object type definition, in Registration tab, create custom register with **Register Custom** URL. Fill in&#x20;

| Object type         | Object type of the documents to be registered with the use of the defined register. Is filled by default with parent Object type.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Classes to register | Specifies the sub-set of the classes from the collection of the classes related with the object type. If this property is empty, then all the classes related with the object type (related with defined register) will be taken into account while performing registration of the documents (documents of the all classes  related with object type will be registered in this register). |

3\) Add the button to the class /-es defined 'under' certain object type. In class form you will find possibility of adding button in 'Toolbar' tab. The definition of the button should be orientated on register action. Please find in below the example definition:

<figure>[](/assets/image_(145).png)</figure>

The button should appear on the appropriate form. After it is pressed, custom registration is triggered. The value of the attribute defined in 1) is filled with the value of 'Next index' of corresponding custom register. After that the 'Next index' in custom register is increased by 1 up. There is no possibility to perform a few times custom registration (with the effect of assigning the next counter from custom register) to the same document. Custom registered document is not locked for deletion (like in standard registration).

You can find more information on register in 'User guide' section, in [register-update.md](../user-guide/registers/register-update.md "mention")  subpage.

### Advanced

This part of the setup is currently used for definition of the templates of cost allocation lines for purchase invoices. You can find it in definition of object type 'Purchase Invoice Costs Allocation' which represents the cost allocation line for the invoice. For this object type as template object is assigned 'Purchase Invoice Costs Allocation TEMPLATE'. In the form, assigned to the class of the template object type, you will find the attributes used for matching of the template to the invoice like: Vendor (key: counterparty) and Author (key: Author) as well the children type attribute which will represent the lines in the template.

## Classes <a href="#classes" id="classes"></a>

### _Introduction_

A class is a sub-type of an object type. A section for classes appears at the bottom of General tab of Object type form, after creating an object type (after the first save).&#x20;

Related with object type classes, represent the different types of the main object type. For example for the object type: 'Employment and Compensation', in system there are defined the following classes (each of them representing special type of employee's employment contract document (contract itself or it's update with annex - amendment) or key event related with it - termination of contract): 'Employment and Compensation', 'Amendment of the employment contract', 'Termination'.

### _Creating the class_

Before creating the class it is recommended to create the form representing the objects of certain class. (see [Forms](forms/)).

To create a class, select **New Class** from object type form, at the bottom of General tab. Most of definition properties (attributes) in class definition are the same as of a parent object type. While creating the new class, system fills in the set of the same attributes from the root object type, which can be used without any change, especially while crating the fist class to the object type. &#x20;

### Access control

Action permissions are set for each object class separately. Objects of the class will be accessible and actions will be allowed only to users which have been assigned with specified roles. The security roles are assigned to the user groups. Every user who is the member of the group is granted with the role assigned to the group. &#x20;

These settings are not mandatory, but be careful - if, let's say, no role is set in Read all field, no one will be able to view objects of this class, unless they are appointed in attributes values for the document or participating in related workflow.&#x20;

### Ledger&#x20;

Ledger is separate table per each company in the system. Every user in the company have a possibility to read it. Records in the ledger are holding basic, public information on the business events, for example the date of absence and employee who is absent. From the business objects like absence request of certain employee for 10 days, there are created 10 separate records in result, each representing the absence in each day in this example. Each created record also holds the information of the quantity per record (in this example 0 (if in requested range are public holidays) or 1). As it presents on the lowest possible granulity the taken or engaged capacity of resource in time, it is used for calendar visualization as well for counting the days requested / taken. &#x20;

| Ledger is negative                     | Enables adding negative capacity values for ledger records for example for cancelation of the leave. Further setup is deployed in featue or app level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

You can find different examples of buttons implementation in: [forms.md](forms/forms.md "mention")&#x20;

### Translation&#x20;

Here you can define which form attributes will be translatable. Translatable means that you will be able to save attribute value in different app languages that are available for you.&#x20;

To specify which attributes will be translatable, enter keys of those attributes separated by comma without spaces (e.g. key1,key2,key3).

**How do translatable attributes work?**&#x20;

Let's say, you have English and Lithuanian languages enabled in the app:&#x20;

1. Set the app language to English.
2. Open an object and enter a translatable attribute's value in English. Save the object.
3. Then set the app language to Lithuanian.
4. Open the same object and enter the same attribute's value in Lithuanian. Save the object.
5. Set the app language back to English.
6. Open the object and find the attribute value written in English.

### Comments

Comments are the related records to the document. They are appearing in separate 'Comments' tab on the document form.  On the list on the right side inside the Comments tab, there is displayed common collection of the comments: these created manually, as well the ones created in workflow processing. Created comments can not be edited, nor deleted. They are available in read only. Author and approvers in workflow which already approved their tasks or have active tasks are receiving the new notifications on creation of the new comment.&#x20;

| _**Attribute**_                                           | _**Description**_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| Use confidential comments                                 | Turns on confidential comments. Confidential comments are available according to the restrictions of security which are defined in Access control tab for the class specified in 'Comments class'.                                                                                                                                                                   |

### Filtered views

Filtered views are alternative views for certain class.

| _**Attribute**_      | _**Description**_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 'Active' statuses    | <p>In the cases the statuses value are defined in here, then on display view of the documents of this class, the view is split to 2 separate views: </p><p>1) ACTIVE - which shows only the documents of appointed statuses,</p><p>2) ALL - shows all documents</p> |
| 'Completed' statuses | Even if defined, are not shown. Anyway as workaround you can define 'New Class filtered view' (explained in below, under this table) as 'Completed' and define statuses accordingly.                                                                                |
| Hide 'All' view      | If "'Active' statuses" are defined, it (the explained option) hides ALL view, so only ACTIVE is available (and other custom defined as Class filtered view).                                                                                                        |
| Employee Key         | Used to filter out leavers ('Ex-worker' attribute not marked up in person card) from the view. Related documents of Ex-workers are not shown up in the view.                                                                                                        |

Class Filtered view is in fact the definition of the new custom view:

| Name              | Displayed name of the view                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

You can find the examples of the filtered views implementation in:

[filtered-view-filter-expression.md](expressions-examples/filtered-view-filter-expression.md "mention")

### Advanced&#x20;

This section allows you to create complex objects that contain other object types as subobjects. This allows you to group related information into one object.&#x20;

* Single - a default option. Use this for stand-alone objects.
* Collection - use this option for complex objects.

| Digital Signature                           | <p>The property enables digital signing. Prior to this setup digital signing has to be enabled in Administration -> Custom company name -> Company info -> Save action -> Settings button -> Digital signature tab -> Digital signature enabled = True, Digital signature provider = should be chosen from the list of available providers -> Save. </p><p>The example of this functionality is enabled in _CORE company, for Contracts -> Contracts. On the form: Contract, there is added special 'relation view' type attribute: E -Signatures , orientated to the object type: Signing party.  This attribute holds the details of the e-signing. When already e-signed document is uploaded the signing details are filled in automatically.  </p><p>The container also can hold the requests for signing / approval which can be created manually and to the Employee or external Customer. On the form menu appears button 'Endorse &#x26; Sign'. </p><p>In related workflow there are dedicated steps, which are related with e-signing. For example 'Contract Processing' workflow contains 'Workflow Step System'  steps:   'Add Signing Person' (which creates e-signing request line  to the person appointed in the form) and  'Sign Document' - the action for e-signing which interacts when triggered with the e-signing request lines.</p> |

## Class Advanced Parameters

### Propagation of the changed attributes values to other related documents

Example 1:

This is the example of the usage class parameters. The scenario is:

There is main document (Candidate form). On it's form there are 2 attributes of relation view control type which are displaying related with this candidate documents:

<figure>[](/assets/image_(188).png)</figure>

&#x20;

The set of actions is:&#x20;

1\) Candidate document is created, where attributes multi-select attributes are filled in 'Recruiters' and 'Involved'. Because of this assignment appointed persons will have the access to the created candidate.&#x20;

2\) Related documents are created from the candidate form. On the forms of these documents there is created another pair of the attributes 'Recruiters' and 'Involved' with 'Read only' option, just in order to propagate the security from candidate to related documents. On the form of the related documents the Default value if setup:

For 'Recruiters' as: &#x20;

```javascript
[ParentValue]:recruiterIds
```

and&#x20;

For 'Involved' as:

```javascript
[ParentValue]:performsRecruitment
```

So while creating the related document from the candidate form (through relation view type of control attribute), then Recruiters and Involved are filled in the same manner as on root candidate. So the same security for related documents can be ensured as for root candidate.

3\) There is a change of set of Recruiters and Involved on Candidate main document. We would like to automatically provide the same security (for updated set of Recruiters and Involved on candidate form) for all the related documents with the candidate, without opening each related document form and saving (which can be achieved this way, when expression is defined for Recruiters and Involved on related documents forms). The solution for this is define in Parameters (placed in Advanced tab) of the class of candidate root document in the following manner:

```json
{
  "copyValues": {
    "relationKeys": [{  
      "relatedDocs": [{ 
         "fromKey": "performsRecruitment", 
         "toKey": "involvedMulti" 
      }, 
     {
         "fromKey": "recruiterIds", 
         "toKey": "recruiterIds" 
      }],
      "relatedIdsCerts": [{  
         "fromKey": "performsRecruitment", 
         "toKey": "involvedMulti" 
      }, 
     {
         "fromKey": "recruiterIds", 
         "toKey": "recruiterIds" 
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```

&#x20;On every save of candidate, from candidate will be copied the values of Recruiters and Involved attributes to related view objects (to related documents).

```
relatedDocs - is the key for relation view attribute (presented on above screenshot under 'Candidate documents')
performsRecruitment - is multi-select type key for Involved attribute on Candidate form
involvedMulti - is multi-select type key for Involved attribute on Candidate document form
recruiterIds - which is placed in "fromKey": "recruiterIds" , is multi-select type key for Recruiters attribute on Candidate form
recruiterIds - which is placed in "toKey": "recruiterIds" , is multi-select type key for Recruiters attribute on Candidate document form

In analogical way attributes are mapped for the following relation view attribute key:
relatedIdsCerts - is the key for relation view attribute (presented on above screenshot under 'Candidate Ids and Certs')

```

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Example 2:

The another example is propagating the changed values from recruitment to the related candidate (Parameters are set up in Recruitment class):

```json
{
  "copyValues": {
    "relationKeys": [{
      "relVieCand2": [{
         "fromKey": "plannedWeek", 
         "toKey": "plannedWeek" 
      }, 
     {
         "fromKey": "branchOfDeploy", 
         "toKey": "branchOfDeploy" 
      }, 
      {
         "fromKey": "typeEmployId", 
         "toKey": "typeEmployId" 
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```

The prerequisite for such scenario is described in:  [#set-the-select-type-attribute-placed-on-candidate-form-which-appoints-to-candidate-with-the-value-of](expressions-examples/workflow-step-system-actions.md#set-the-select-type-attribute-placed-on-candidate-form-which-appoints-to-candidate-with-the-value-of "mention")

## How to create Setup data entries

Object type with setup data type allows you to create classificators, i.e. lists of entries that can be used in object forms as predefined options. Examples of classificators are list of leave types, list of contract types, list of business trip types that a user can choose from when creating a document.

You must have administrator rights to be able to create setup data entries.

To create a setup data entry, go to Administration > Setup. The object type with setup data type you've created will be listed here automatically. Open it and select the button for creating a new entry. Edit the required settings and save the entry.&#x20;

When an entry is created, it will automatically become available in select attributes in object forms.

## Facet expressions

### Default expression

The default facet expression sets name of an object as its label. It takes the value of an attribute with a key 'name' and uses it as a label.

```
'${name}'
```

### Other attributes in a facet

You can modify the facet expression to use values of other attributes or add more information to the label.

To use the author of an object as a label, enter:

```
'${employee}'
```

This expression will take values of two attributes to build a label:

```
'${employee}, ${typeOfDocument}'
```

For a child object, you can use the facet expression of a parent object:

```
'${parentId._facet}'
```

An expression that combines several values and gives a detailed info about an object in the label:

```
BT: ${employeeId}| to: ${countriesList} | dates ${dateBtFrom}-${dateBtTo}
```

### How to setup date in a facet

```javascript
var date = new Date('${expirationDate}');
var month = '' + (date.getMonth() + 1);
var day = '' + date.getDate();
var year = date.getFullYear();

if (month.length < 2) {
    month = '0' + month;
}
if (day.length < 2) {
   day = '0' + day;
}

var dateString = [year, month, day].join('-');

return '${employee}, Due Date: ' + dateString;
```

### How to setup date from and to in a facet

```javascript
var dateFrom = new Date('${dateFrom}');
var monthFrom = '' + (dateFrom.getMonth() + 1);
var dayFrom = '' + dateFrom.getDate();
var yearFrom = dateFrom.getFullYear();

if (monthFrom.length < 2) {
    monthFrom = '0' + monthFrom;
}
if (dayFrom.length < 2) {
   dayFrom = '0' + dayFrom;
}

var dateTo = new Date('${dateTo}');
var monthTo = '' + (dateTo.getMonth() + 1);
var dayTo = '' + dateTo.getDate();
var yearTo = dateTo.getFullYear();

if (monthTo.length < 2) {
    monthTo = '0' + monthTo;
}
if (dayTo.length < 2) {
   dayTo = '0' + dayTo;
}

var dateStringFrom = [yearFrom, monthFrom, dayFrom].join('-');
var dateStringTo = [yearTo, monthTo, dayTo].join('-');

return '${employee}, '+dateStringFrom + ' to ' + dateStringTo + ('${comment}' ? ', Comment: ${comment}' : '');
```

### How to set up a condition in a facet

```javascript
return '${employee}, ' + ('${comment}' ? ', Comment: ${comment}' : '');
```

## Object Type Class Ledger setup

Ledger split keys are keys used to identify date. Examples:

"dataRange"

dateFrom, dateTo

"Ledger keys" examples

```javascript
employee=>person,datesRange=>fromTo
```

```javascript
employee=>person,dateFrom=>from,dateTo=>to
```
