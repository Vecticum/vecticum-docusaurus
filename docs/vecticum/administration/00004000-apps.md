# Apps

An app is a small program designed to fulfill a very specific business task. In Vecticum, you can configure your own apps from the predefined building blocks (object types, forms, views, workflows, user roles, etc).

To create a new app, go to Administration > Metadata > Apps and select **New App**.

First, edit general settings of the app.

Once the general settings are saved, sections for configuring navigation items for the app, app buttons, app stats and app roles will be displayed.

### Navigation items

In this section, you'll configure how your app will be accessed from the main menu of your company's system. When you edit the general settings of the app and save them, the app is created but not yet visible in the menu. To make the app displayed in the menu and visible for users, you have to create navigation items and specify which user roles will have the access to them.

Please follow the below URL in order to navigate to Navigation Item setup description:

### App roles

For each app you can create dedicated roles and use them to control who can see and access app features.&#x20;

When a role is created here, you have to do two things: set this role for a navigation item and assign the role to users. When assigning a role to a navigation item, you control which group of users will be able to access this part of the system. When assigning a role to users, you create this control group.

To create a new role for the app, select **New Role**.
