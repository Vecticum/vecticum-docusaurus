# Apps

An app is a small program designed to fulfill a very specific business task. In Vecticum, you can configure your own apps from the predefined building blocks (object types, forms, views, workflows, user roles, etc).

To create a new app, go to Administration > Metadata > Apps and select **New App**.

First, edit general settings of the app.

Once the general settings are saved, sections for configuring navigation items for the app, app buttons, app stats and app roles will be displayed.

### Navigation items

In this section, you'll configure how your app will be accessed from the main menu of your company's system. When you edit the general settings of the app and save them, the app is created but not yet visible in the menu. To make the app displayed in the menu and visible for users, you have to create navigation items and specify which user roles will have the access to them.

To create a new navigation item, select **New Navigation Item**.
