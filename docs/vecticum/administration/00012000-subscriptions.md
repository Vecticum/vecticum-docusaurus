# Subscriptions

Subsrciptions are responsible for the setup of the email notifications delivery.&#x20;

There are inbuilt notifications in Vecticum platform:

* on assignment of the new workflow task - sent immediately once the task is assigned to responsible performer. In the content of the notification email there is navigation button which navigates to the document which has the new active task assigned. &#x20;

* group email notification delivered daily for responsible performer of the tasks. In the email notification are listed all the tasks which are near the deadline or overdue after the deadline and where recipient is responsible performer for the task. They are delivered once a day (currently: 2023-06-29, everyday at around 9:00 AM EEST â€” Eastern European Summer Time (UTC/GMT +3 hours) ). If  a user has created the account in different vecticum companies then separate email notification is sent per each company regarding her/his near / overdue active tasks.&#x20;
